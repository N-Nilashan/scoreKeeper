# Ping Pong Score Keeper
This is a simple web-based scorekeeper application for ping pong matches. It allows users to track the scores of two players and determine a winning score threshold.

## Features
Keep track of scores for two players.
Select the winning score threshold from predefined options (3, 5, 7, or 10).
Reset the scores to start a new game.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS (Bulma CSS framework)
JavaScript

## How to Use
Open the **index.html** file in a web browser.
Select the desired winning score threshold from the dropdown menu.
Click the **"+1"** button corresponding to the player who scores a point.
Once a player reaches the winning score, the game ends, and further score updates are disabled.
To start a new game, click the **"Reset"** button.

## Challenges Faced
**DOM Manipulation:** Working with the DOM in JavaScript to update the score display and handle button clicks efficiently.

**Game Logic:** Implementing the logic to determine when the game ends based on the winning score threshold.

**Styling:** Ensuring the application has a clean and user-friendly interface using Bulma CSS framework.

## Future Ideas
**Multiplayer Support:** Allow for tracking scores of more than two players for games involving multiple participants.
**Customizable Winning Score:** Enable users to input a custom winning score threshold instead of selecting from predefined options.
**Mobile Optimization:** Optimize the application for mobile devices to improve accessibility and user experience.
**History Tracking:** Implement a feature to track the history of games played, including scores and winners.
**Themes:** Provide different theme options for users to customize the look and feel of the application.

## File Structure
**index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
**app.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for updating scores and handling game events.
**img/:** Directory containing image assets used in the application.
